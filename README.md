## Objective
Design and implement a useful and interesting web application related to movies.
Our site enables students in the beginning of their career as filmmakers to learn about the industry, in order to make more successful career choices.

Which genre is the most successful? Which production house has the most successful films? Who is the director who worked with the most actors? Our site will help its users get to know the world of cinema in depth,
and also to know who are the key people which they would want to connect with.
